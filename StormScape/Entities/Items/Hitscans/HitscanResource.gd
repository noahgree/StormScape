## The resource defining the parameters for how the hitscan beam acts and looks (if using vfx override).

@export_group("General")
@export var continuous_beam: bool = true ## Whether to keep the hitscan on and continue to consume ammo while the trigger is held. Has no effect if the firing mode is set to CHARGE.

@export_custom(PROPERTY_HINT_NONE, "suffix:pixels") var hitscan_max_distance: int = 225 ## The max distance the hitscan ray can travel.
@export var hitscan_pierce_count: int ## How many objects the hitscan can pierce through.

@export_group("Falloff")
@export var hitscan_effect_falloff: Curve ## The falloff for the effects applied to the receiver of the hitscan.
@export var bad_effects_falloff: bool = true ## Whether the bad effects of the effect source falloff.
@export var good_effects_falloff: bool = false ## Whether the good effects of the effect source falloff.

@export var impact_particle_color: Color = Color.PINK ## The color of the particles at the impact site.
@export var impact_particle_mult: float = 1.0 ## Multiplies the amount of emitted particles for the impact site of the hitscan.
@export var beam_particle_color: Color = Color.RED ## The color of the particles along the beam.
@export var beam_particle_mult: float = 1.0 ## Multiplies the amount of emitted particles for the beam of the hitscan.
