@export var ricochet_angle_bounce: bool = true ## Whether the ricochets should bounce at an angle or just reverse the direction they were travelling in. Note that when colliding with TileMaps, it always just reverses direction.

@export_custom(PROPERTY_HINT_NONE, "suffix:seconds") var split_delays: Array[float] = [0.2] ## For each split index, you should assign how long after the last projectile spawn to wait before splitting again. The first delay is the delay before the initial split.

@export_range(0, 30, 0.01) var split_cam_shakes_str: Array[float] = [1.0] ## For each split index, you should determine how strong the camera shake will be at the split.

@export var splash_before_freeing: bool = false ## Whether to trigger the splash once we reach end of lifetime if we haven't hit anything yet.
